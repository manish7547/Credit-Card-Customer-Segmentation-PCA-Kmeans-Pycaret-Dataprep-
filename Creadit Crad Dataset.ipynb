Typically ,the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud ,a structural defect,medical problems or errors .This module  provide several pre-processing feature that prepares the data for modeling through setup function.This modules has over 12 ready-to-use algorithms and several plots to analyze the results of trained models.
